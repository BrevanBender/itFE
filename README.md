Welcome to one stop itinerary!
Easily add update delete and read trips created by our users.
Simple design makes it so easy grandma could use it.
The front end work was in line with current events(easter)
There may be some hidden features on the page, but who knows?

This week alot of my time went toward outcomes qualification and the interview process with a company.
With that in mind I wanted to keep the backend simple to avoid spreading myself too thin.
I'm also currently revamping my portfolio site and optimizing previous projects.

I used a django backend with a single trip model. This model used only strings for it's different fields.
Frontend was react with a trip container that fetched the api data. The app base level was strictly for aesthetics.
